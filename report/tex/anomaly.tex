\section{Anomaly Detection using Particle Level EFPs}
\label{sec:anomaly}

\textcolor{yellow}{
    Write about the following here:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item How EFP preserves inner rotational symmetry therefore does not encode useless information.
        \item Sampling technique to escape computational complexity
        \item Example of how this adds to the resilliance against clustering errors.
    \end{itemize}

\textcolor{red}{Energy Flow Polynomials will be used as inputs to auto-encoders which are easier to construct} ~\cite{tuhin_autoencoder}.

\textcolor{red}{The proof of concept for this will be shown using a similar toy model as proposed in the abstract for the LDA paper which is also doing similar Beyond-Standard-Model searches (like the toy vector-scalar boson model)} ~\cite{lda_jets}.
